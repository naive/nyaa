The header shows the current category you're browsing (e.g.
"Anime >> English-translated Anime") in addition to:

 * "Size" refers to size of the files in the torrent 
 * "SE" is the number of seeders
 * "LE" is the number of leechers

In the footer, "view" shows which results are currently being displayed,
and the total results for your search. "recv" shows the number results
currently loaded/fetched. If you page through results too fast, you
might have to wait a second for more results to be fetched. "page" shows
how many pages of results there are.

You probably also noticed that some torrents are different colors. The 
colors correspond to the filters on nyaa.eu. For example, trusted torrents
are green and A+ torrents are blue. These colors depend on your terminal
color settings, so they might different in your terminal.
